# 🤖 Jarvis – Personal AI Assistant

Jarvis is a Python-based personal AI assistant that supports voice and text interaction, system automation, and intelligent command handling.

It is designed as a learning-focused, extensible desktop assistant, inspired by real-world AI systems.

🚧 **Status:** Actively under development

---

## ✨ Features

### 🗣️ Voice & Text Interaction
- Voice-based interaction (Speech Recognition + Text-to-Speech)
- Text input via GUI
- Wake-word activation (**Jarvis**)
- Continuous conversation mode (no repeated wake word for 120 seconds)

### 🧠 Intelligent Command Handling
- Rule-based intent detection
- LLM fallback (OpenAI / Gemini) for unknown intents

### ⚙️ Automation & Actions
- Open / close apps
- Open folders & files
- System control (shutdown/restart)
- Weather updates using OpenWeather API
- WhatsApp automation (planned/optional)

### 🧱 Architecture
- Modular and clean architecture
- Separate files for routing, intent detection, automation, output, etc.

### 🔐 Secure API Key Handling
- API keys are stored in `.env`
- `.env` is ignored in git via `.gitignore`

## 🔐 Environment Setup

API keys are never hardcoded.

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
GEMINI_KEY=path_to_gemini_json_key
OPENWEATHER_KEY=your_openweather_api_key

Make sure `.env` is added to `.gitignore`.

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

## ⚙️ Supported Intents (So far)
Intent	Example Commands
OPEN	open chrome / open folder / open file
CLOSE	close notepad / close app
SHUTDOWN	shutdown system
RESTART	restart system
EXIT	exit / quit / close jarvis
UNKNOWN	fallback to LLM

## 🧠 Roadmap

Persistent memory (JSON / SQLite)
Plugin-based skill system
Improved intent classification
Personality modes
Offline command support
Packaging as executable (.exe)
